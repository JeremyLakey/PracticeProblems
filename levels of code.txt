In any field there are levels of skills.

From beginners to grand masters to world champions. Understanding the difference and behavior between the levels can guide development. 

# Level Zero

The mark a beginner is a lack of how much they lack. Generally, a beginner isn't doubtful of their capabilities, because they do not have a reference to judge themselves.

Unlike higher levels, a level zero has no way previous knowledge to judge learning resources or outcomes. Often they do have a goal, and tend to value hgighly results over fundamentals. 

Teaching a level zero results in frustration. More so from a lack of common jargon and thinking patterns, than malice or a lack of potential. What a level zero needs is a list of achievable objective and an outlet to discuss discovery.

# Level One (

Level one engineers know enough to ask questions. At this point, they understand basics jargon, but lack the experience to thinking like an engineer.

The greatest disservice to a level one is teaching them more programming languages and frame works. Instead they need to develop a method of thinking deeply.

Often level ones have slightly over optimistic projects. They should not be stopped from attempting a project, because they will soon discover the limits of their design thinking.

Most importantly level ones need to push established knowledge to it's limits. Building experience designing and solving problems pushes their thinking to new dimensions.
